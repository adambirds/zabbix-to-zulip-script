# Zabbix to Zulip Alert Script

This `zulip.sh` script allows you to send alert notifications to your [Zulip](https://github.com/zulip/zulip) server.

The script will need to be stored on your **Zabbix Server** in your `alertscripts` folder.

This is usually `/user/lib/zabbix/alertscripts`. This may depend on your environment, please refer to the documentation for your environment.
